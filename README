Stochastic Definite Clause Grammars
===================================

SDCG is a compiler which compiles from an extended version of Prologs
DCG syntax to a stochastic program expressed using the amazing PRISM
system.

It is intended to be used for natural language parsing which requires
something a bit more expressive than stochastic context-free grammars.
