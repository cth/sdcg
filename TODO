TODO
====

FOC compilation:
- Implement all rules with a "rule" clause, where the implementation rule is matched 
- Get rid of consume. replace consume/3 replaced by "in-rule" consumption.
	- This might be trouble some for rules like "s ==> [a], [b]" or worse "s ==> [a], b, [c]".

- Test cases for all rules not currently being tested

- Example grammars
	- Lexical grammar (using @ expansions)
	- General purpose, wide-coverage english grammar
- Some way (syntax) of setting the probability when defining rules
