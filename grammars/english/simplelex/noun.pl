% Features are: Number, Person, Case, Gender
% Values for Number: sing,plur,interogative
% Values for Person: first,second,third
% Values for Case: subjective, objective, possesive-determiner, possesive-nomimal, reflexive.
% I dont think pronouns can be countable!

% First-person singular:
pronoun(sing,first,subjective,@gender(G)) ==> [ 'I' ].
pronoun(sing,first,objective,@gender(G)) ==> [ 'me' ].
pronoun(sing,first,possesive-determiner,@gender(G)) ==> [ 'my' ].
