The brown corpus here is an prolog adaptation of the Bergen
version of the Corpus. The brown_corpus_whole.pl contains
the whole corpus, but unfortunately Bprolog doesn't like 
compiling this big a file. So I have split the file in to
parts as well. These are located in the parts/ directory.
the file brown_parts.pl compiles each of these parts. 
On my computer (Macbook pro), it takes around a minute 
to compile all the files, so be patient...
